sudo apt-get install wmctrl

add do ~/.bashrc
export HOTKEY_DIR="name of directory"
source ~/.bashrc

add same to ~/.profile
then restart (otherwise the command will work, but not when called via hotkey)

Add shortcuts programatically:

user.conf.extras are the keyboard shortcuts, which were generated by running
dconf dump / > user.conf
and then pruning down to the custom-keybindings

We can then load this with the following commands, which first write the current
dconf settings to a file, add our custom shortcuts to this config file, and then
reload the amended file as our new settings:
- dconf dump / > ~/.config/dconf/user.conf
- Append user.conf.extra to the end of this file
- echo user-db:user > temporary-profile
- DCONF_PROFILE="$(pwd)/temporary-profile" dconf load / < ~/.config/dconf/user.conf

The mucking around with temporary-profile is necessary to avoid the error:
"error: The operation attempted to modify one or more non-writable keys"
