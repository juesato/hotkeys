sudo apt-get install wmctrl

add do ~/.bashrc
export HOTKEY_DIR="name of directory"
source ~/.bashrc

add same to ~/.profile
then restart (otherwise the command will work, but not when called via hotkey)

Add shortcuts programatically:

user.conf.extras are the keyboard shortcuts, which were generated by running
dconf dump / > user.conf
and then pruning down to the custom-keybindings

We can then load this with the following commands, which first write the current
dconf settings to a file, add our custom shortcuts to this config file, and then
reload the amended file as our new settings:
- dconf dump / > ~/.config/dconf/user.conf
- Append user.conf.extra to the end of this file. It may be necessary to slightly tweak user.conf. [See Fn 1]
- echo user-db:user > temporary-profile
- DCONF_PROFILE="$(pwd)/temporary-profile" dconf load / < ~/.config/dconf/user.conf

The mucking around with temporary-profile is necessary to avoid the error:
"error: The operation attempted to modify one or more non-writable keys"
- Need to log in and out, in order for changes to become active.

* For example, on newest thinkpad, I had to change "org/cinnamon/desktop/keybindings/custom-keybindings/custom" to "org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom" (which was determined by adding a hotkey through the GUI, and seeing how the formatting of ~/.config/dconf/user.conf looks)
* May also be necessary to modify something like the below to include all the necessary indices.
> [org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]
custom-keybindings=['/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/', '/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom1/']
